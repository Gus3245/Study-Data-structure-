This is a repository that has content and codes related to data structures, most of the basic data structures such as Queues (FIFO), First in First out, Stacks (LIFOS) last in first out, doubly linked lists and other important structures.

Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. They define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program. Understanding data structures is very important for developing efficient and effective algorithms.

## Classification of Data Structure

    1. Linear Data Structure: Data structure in which 
       data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly,
       where each element is attached to its previous and next 
       adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 

    2. Static Data Structure: tatic data structure has a fixed
       memory size. It is easier to access the elements 
       in a static data structure. 

    3. Dynamic Data Structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed.
       It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered 
       efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 

    4. Non_Linear Data Structure: Data structures where data elements are not 
       placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. 
       In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a 
       single run only.
